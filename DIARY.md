i have found this documentation about mediapipe https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/face_detector#get_started that i find it is quite interesting and shows quite a lot of other things that can be maybe used in the future of the project.
i have also saw the OpenCV documentation https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/ where all of the methods are explained into detail. i find it interesting that the cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB) method interesting aperantly it is converting the existing view into another color space, and there is quite a bit of color spaces available. in this case the color space is RGB
did some testing where it shows if a face is detected or not. when the face is not shown the input terminal will print "none" and if there is a face the coordinates of the center of the face is shown.
